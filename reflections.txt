How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


    -> it was easy and fast and effective doing it this way.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


    -> I review my progress anytime and can also rverse my wrong decisions. So, it helps.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


    -> I like doing it manually and I do it frequently. Therefore I like like way of git.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


    -> Both types can be useful depending upon the the type of project we are working.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


    -> git log command is used to see all the commits that has been made and git diff is used to see difference between two commits of same files or the difference between two separate files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?


    -> It makes me very confident about making changes and try new things.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


    -> I do not know.
